# Defining terms clearly

Clear definitions are essential to effective scientific writing.
Every specialized term should have an explicit,
concise definition immediately before or after its first use.
Readers should not need to search for the meaning of a term
or infer it from context alone.

::: {#def-term}

## Term

A *term* is a word or phrase with a specific,
technical meaning within a particular field or context.

:::

::: {#exm-population}

## Population

::: {#def-population}

## Population

In statistics,
the term "population" refers to the complete set of all items or individuals of interest,
not just a geographic population of people.

## Guidelines for defining terms

Follow these principles when introducing new terms:

- **Provide explicit definitions:**
  State clearly what a term means,
  rather than assuming readers will understand from context.
  
- **Be concise:**
  Definitions should be brief and focused,
  using only the words necessary to convey the meaning.
  
- **Define terms at first use:**
  Place the definition immediately before or after the term's first appearance.
  
- **Provide examples:**
  Every definition should include at least one concrete example
  that illustrates how the term is used.

## Examples of term definitions

Here are examples of well-defined terms:

::: {#exm-confidence-interval}

## Statistical term: Confidence interval

::: {#def-confidence-interval}

## Confidence interval

A *confidence interval* is a range of values,
derived from sample statistics,
that is likely to contain the true population parameter.

:::

If we calculate a 95% confidence interval for mean height as [165 cm, 175 cm],
we are 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this range.

:::

::: {#exm-active-voice}

## Writing term: Active voice

::: {#def-active-voice}

## Active voice

*Active voice* is a sentence structure where the subject performs the action expressed by the verb.

:::

"The researcher conducted the experiment" is in active voice,
while "The experiment was conducted by the researcher" is in passive voice.

:::

## Why examples matter

Examples serve several crucial purposes:

- **Concrete understanding:**
  Examples transform abstract concepts into tangible instances
  that readers can visualize and understand.
  
- **Verification:**
  Readers can work through examples themselves
  to verify they understand the definition or theorem.
  
- **Application:**
  Examples show how to apply definitions and theorems
  to solve real problems.
  
- **Memory:**
  Concrete examples are easier to remember
  than abstract definitions alone.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Circular definitions:**
  Do not define a term using the term itself.
  
  **Incorrect:**
  "Conciseness is the quality of being concise."
  
  **Correct:**
  "Conciseness is the quality of expressing ideas
  using only the words necessary to communicate meaning clearly."
  
- **Vague definitions:**
  Avoid definitions that rely on imprecise language.
  
  **Incorrect:**
  "A variable is something that can change."
  
  **Correct:**
  "A variable is a symbol representing a value
  that can take on different values."
  
- **Missing examples:**
  Never leave a definition without at least one example.
  
- **Examples without context:**
  Ensure examples clearly illustrate the specific aspect
  of the definition they are meant to demonstrate.

## Mathematical statements require examples

Mathematical theorems,
lemmas,
corollaries,
and postulates should always include examples
that demonstrate their application.
Abstract mathematical statements become more accessible
when readers can see concrete instances.
