    "text": "I recommend trying to replace Latin-derived words and phrases with Old English-derived equivalents (“Anglish” words) where possible; it generally makes writing simpler and easier to read. Latin words  create artificial barriers to understanding. Many Latin-derived words commonly used in scientific writing are composed from roots and affixes which are not commonly used in their basic forms; hence, readers cannot determine the meanings of these words by decomposing them. Instead, they need to memorize the meanings of these words directly. In contrast, the components of composite Anglish words are typically also used individually, so the meanings of the composites can be derived directly. Table 2.1 lists some common Latinate words and phrases and Anglish alternatives.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Commonly used Latin words and phrases and Anglish alternatives\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nAnglish\n\n\n\n\nprior to\nbefore\n\n\nnecessary\nneeded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also https://bark-fa.github.io/Anglish-Translator/\nI am aware that this book, and even this chapter, contains many Latin word choices where there are Anglish alternatives. It is a work in progress, and also, I am not advocating 100% Anglish purity. Use whichever words and phrases you think your readers are most likely to understand easily. Preferring Anglish is merely a useful heuristic to help achieve our ultimate goal of producing clear, easy-to-read writing.\nJust to be clear, although I prefer Anglish words, I have no particular preference for Anglish people or culture; it is only a practical consideration, based on the realities of English as the current default language of science and the relatively-recent hybridization of the English language.",

    "text": "3.1 Common ways to improve conciseness\nConcise writing conveys ideas efficiently, using only the words necessary to communicate meaning clearly. Every word should serve a purpose. Eliminate redundancy and verbosity. When you can express an idea in fewer words without losing meaning, do so.\nMany effective writers throughout history have exemplified this principle, including Julius Caesar, whose Commentarii and phrases like “Veni, vidi, vici” demonstrate the power of brevity (Wikipedia contributors 2026).\nRemember: concise writing is not about making every sentence as short as possible, but about removing words that do not contribute to meaning or clarity.",
