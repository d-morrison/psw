Clear grammar removes friction between your ideas and your reader. This chapter collects a few grammatical habits that consistently make scientific writing easier to read.

## 1 Relative pronouns

Relative pronouns (*that*, *which*, *who*, *whom*, and *whose*) introduce a clause that describes a preceding noun. Two habits make these clauses easier to read: choosing between *that* and *which* correctly, and keeping the relative pronoun rather than dropping it.

### 1.1 Restrictive vs. non-restrictive clauses: *that* vs. *which*

Use *that* for a **restrictive** clause — one that identifies which thing you mean, and that cannot be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence. Use *which*, set off by commas, for a **non-restrictive** clause — one that adds information the reader does not need in order to know which thing you mean.

> **NOTE:**
>
> **Example 1 (Restrictive clause (*that*))**  
>
> > The dataset **that** we collected in 2023 contains 4,000 records.
>
> The clause “that we collected in 2023” tells the reader which dataset we mean. Removing it changes the meaning, so the clause is restrictive and takes *that* with no comma.

> **NOTE:**
>
> **Example 2 (Non-restrictive clause (*which*))**  
>
> > Our 2023 dataset, **which** contains 4,000 records, is publicly available.
>
> The clause “which contains 4,000 records” adds a detail, but the reader already knows which dataset we mean. The clause is non-restrictive, so it takes *which* and is set off by commas.

A quick test: if you can drop the clause without changing which thing you are describing, use *which* and commas; otherwise, use *that*.

### 1.2 Do not omit relative pronouns

English lets you drop a relative pronoun in some sentences, but keeping it makes the structure of the sentence explicit and easier to parse on the first read. Prefer to keep *that*, *which*, or *who*, even when the grammar would let you drop it.

> **NOTE:**
>
> **Example 3 (Restoring an omitted relative pronoun)**  
>
> > ❌ This body of work laid the methodological groundwork I now apply to enteric fever.
> >
> > ✅ This body of work laid the methodological groundwork **that** I now apply to enteric fever.
>
> The word “that” signals immediately that a describing clause is beginning, so the reader does not briefly misread “the methodological groundwork I” as a single phrase and then have to backtrack.

## 2 Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative words (*this*, *that*, *these*, and *those*) can serve two roles. As adjectives, they modify a noun: “**this** result”, “**those** samples”. As standalone pronouns, they replace a noun: “**This** shows…”, “**That** means…”.

When a demonstrative stands alone as a pronoun, the reader has to search backward for its referent — and often the referent is a whole preceding clause rather than a single noun, which leaves the reference ambiguous. Prefer to follow a demonstrative with the noun it points to, so the reference is explicit.

> **NOTE:**
>
> **Example 4 (Naming the referent)**  
>
> > ❌ The model overfit the training data. **This** poses a problem for deployment.
> >
> > ✅ The model overfit the training data. **This overfitting** poses a problem for deployment.
>
> Adding the noun “overfitting” states exactly what “this” refers to, instead of leaving the reader to infer it.
