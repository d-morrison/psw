# Conciseness

Concise writing conveys ideas efficiently,
using only the words necessary to communicate meaning clearly.
Every word should serve a purpose.
Eliminate redundancy and verbosity.
When you can express an idea in fewer words without losing meaning,
do so.

## Common ways to improve conciseness

- Remove redundant phrases
  - "in order to" → "to"
  - "due to the fact that" → "because"
  - "at this point in time" → "now"
  - "a large number of" → "many"
  
- Use active voice instead of passive where appropriate
  - "The experiment was conducted by the researchers" → "The researchers conducted the experiment"
  
- Eliminate unnecessary qualifiers
  - "very", "really", "quite" often add little meaning
  
- Replace wordy phrases with single words
  - "make a decision" → "decide"
  - "give consideration to" → "consider"
  - "is able to" → "can"

Remember: concise writing is not about making every sentence as short as possible,
but about removing words that do not contribute to meaning or clarity.

## Examples of concise writing

Many effective writers throughout history have exemplified the principle of conciseness.

Julius Caesar's *Commentarii* and phrases like "Veni, vidi, vici" 
demonstrate the power of brevity [@caesar_gallic].

Ernest Hemingway was known for his spare,
direct prose style.
His short sentences and simple words conveyed complex ideas and emotions
without unnecessary embellishment [@hemingway_style].
