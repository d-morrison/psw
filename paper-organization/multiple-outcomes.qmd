When analyzing multiple outcomes separately,
**group your results section by outcome** rather than by analysis type.
This organization improves clarity and readability
by keeping all information about each outcome together.

#### Why group by outcome

Grouping by outcome helps readers:

- Follow the story of each outcome from descriptive statistics through final results
- Compare findings across outcomes more easily
- Understand the complete picture for each outcome before moving to the next
- Navigate directly to outcomes of interest

#### How to organize by outcome

For each outcome,
present:

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Main analysis results
3. Sensitivity analyses
4. Subgroup analyses (if applicable)

**Structure:**

```
Results
├── Outcome 1: Mortality
│   ├── Descriptive statistics
│   ├── Main analysis
│   ├── Sensitivity analyses
│   └── Subgroup analyses
├── Outcome 2: Hospital readmission
│   ├── Descriptive statistics
│   ├── Main analysis
│   ├── Sensitivity analyses
│   └── Subgroup analyses
└── Outcome 3: Quality of life
    ├── Descriptive statistics
    ├── Main analysis
    ├── Sensitivity analyses
    └── Subgroup analyses
```

#### What to avoid

**Don't group by analysis type** when outcomes are analyzed separately:

```
Results (POOR ORGANIZATION)
├── Descriptive statistics
│   ├── Mortality
│   ├── Hospital readmission
│   └── Quality of life
├── Main analyses
│   ├── Mortality
│   ├── Hospital readmission
│   └── Quality of life
└── Sensitivity analyses
    ├── Mortality
    ├── Hospital readmission
    └── Quality of life
```

This forces readers to jump back and forth between sections
to understand the complete story for any single outcome.

#### Exception: Shared descriptive statistics

If your descriptive statistics apply to all outcomes
(e.g., baseline characteristics in a clinical trial),
present them once at the beginning before discussing individual outcomes.
