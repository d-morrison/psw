When writing mathematical or technical content in Quarto,
use theorem environments to demarcate and highlight the structure of your content.
These environments provide consistent formatting,
automatic numbering,
and cross-reference capabilities.

Quarto provides built-in theorem environments including:

- `#thm-` for theorems
- `#lem-` for lemmas
- `#cor-` for corollaries
- `#prp-` for propositions
- `#cnj-` for conjectures
- `#def-` for definitions
- `#exm-` for examples
- `#exr-` for exercises

See the [Quarto documentation on theorems and proofs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs) for complete details.

**Example syntax:**

```markdown
::: {#thm-pythagorean}

## Pythagorean theorem

In a right triangle,
the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

:::
```

This produces automatically numbered output like "Theorem 2.1 (Pythagorean theorem)"
and can be referenced elsewhere in your document using `@thm-pythagorean`.
