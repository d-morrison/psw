# Paper Organization

Effective organization helps readers navigate your scientific paper
and understand your findings.
The structure of your paper should guide readers logically
from your research question through your methods to your results and conclusions.

## Standard paper structure

Most scientific papers follow the IMRaD structure:

- **Introduction**: Present the research question and background
- **Methods**: Describe how the study was conducted
- **Results**: Present the findings
- **Discussion**: Interpret the findings and their implications

Some papers combine Results and Discussion into a single section.

## Organizing the Results section

The Results section presents your findings clearly and logically.
How you organize this section depends on your research design
and the complexity of your analyses.

### Single outcome studies

When analyzing a single primary outcome,
organize results by:

- Descriptive statistics first
- Main analysis results
- Sensitivity analyses or subgroup analyses

### Multiple outcomes analyzed separately

## Figures and tables

Place figures and tables near the relevant text that describes them.
Number them sequentially
and reference them in the text before they appear.

Each figure and table should have a clear,
informative caption that allows readers to understand it
without reading the main text.

## Subsection headings

Use descriptive subsection headings to guide readers through your results.
Headings should clearly indicate the content of each section.

**Poor heading**: "Analysis 1"

**Better heading**: "Association between treatment and mortality"

**Best heading**: "Treatment reduced mortality by 30%"
(when appropriate and not overstating findings)
