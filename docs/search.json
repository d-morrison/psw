    "text": "2.1 Guidelines for defining terms\nClear definitions are essential to effective scientific writing. Every specialized term should have an explicit, concise definition immediately before or after its first use. Readers should not need to search for the meaning of a term or infer it from context alone.\nDefinition: A term is a word or phrase with a specific, technical meaning within a particular field or context.\nExample: In statistics, the term “population” refers to the complete set of all items or individuals of interest, not just a geographic population of people.\nFollow these principles when introducing new terms:",

    "section": "2.3 Mathematical statements require examples",
    "text": "2.3 Mathematical statements require examples\nMathematical theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and postulates should always include examples that demonstrate their application. Abstract mathematical statements become more accessible when readers can see concrete instances.\nDefinition: A theorem is a statement that has been proven to be true based on previously established statements and axioms.\nExample: The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5: \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2\\).\nDefinition: A lemma is a proven statement used as a stepping stone to prove a larger theorem.\nExample: Euclid’s Lemma states that if a prime number divides a product of two integers, it must divide at least one of those integers. If 5 divides 15 × 6 = 90, then 5 must divide either 15 or 6. Indeed, 5 divides 15.\nDefinition: A corollary is a statement that follows readily from a theorem that has already been proven.\nExample: A corollary of the Pythagorean theorem is that in an isosceles right triangle with legs of length \\(a\\), the hypotenuse has length \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\). For a triangle with legs of length 5, the hypotenuse is \\(5\\sqrt{2} \\approx 7.07\\).\nDefinition: A postulate (or axiom) is a statement accepted as true without proof, serving as a starting point for further reasoning.\nExample: Euclid’s fifth postulate (the parallel postulate) states that through a point not on a line, exactly one line can be drawn parallel to the given line. If we have line \\(L\\) and point \\(P\\) not on \\(L\\), only one line through \\(P\\) will never intersect \\(L\\).",

    "text": "I recommend trying to replace Latin-derived words and phrases with Old English-derived equivalents (“Anglish” words) where possible; it generally makes writing simpler and easier to read. Latin words  create artificial barriers to understanding. Many Latin-derived words commonly used in scientific writing are composed from roots and affixes which are not commonly used in their basic forms; hence, readers cannot determine the meanings of these words by decomposing them. Instead, they need to memorize the meanings of these words directly. In contrast, the components of composite Anglish words are typically also used individually, so the meanings of the composites can be derived directly. Table 3.1 lists some common Latinate words and phrases and Anglish alternatives.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Commonly used Latin words and phrases and Anglish alternatives\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nAnglish\n\n\n\n\nprior to\nbefore\n\n\nnecessary\nneeded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also https://bark-fa.github.io/Anglish-Translator/\nI am aware that this book, and even this chapter, contains many Latin word choices where there are Anglish alternatives. It is a work in progress, and also, I am not advocating 100% Anglish purity. Use whichever words and phrases you think your readers are most likely to understand easily. Preferring Anglish is merely a useful heuristic to help achieve our ultimate goal of producing clear, easy-to-read writing.\nJust to be clear, although I prefer Anglish words, I have no particular preference for Anglish people or culture; it is only a practical consideration, based on the realities of English as the current default language of science and the relatively-recent hybridization of the English language.",
