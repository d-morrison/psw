This principle is fundamental to maintaining credibility, enabling verification, and building on the accumulated knowledge of the scientific community.\nScientific writing aims to convey truthful, verifiable information. Unsupported claims undermine this goal in several ways:\nWhen you make a claim, you are asking readers to accept it as true. They deserve to know why they should trust that claim.",

Well-established facts that are common knowledge within your field (e.g., “DNA is a double helix” in molecular biology) can be stated without citation. However, when in doubt, provide a citation—over-citing is preferable to under-citing.",

Consider these factors when evaluating trustworthiness:\n\n2.4.1 Peer review\nPeer-reviewed publications in reputable journals have undergone expert scrutiny. This doesn’t guarantee correctness, but it provides a baseline level of quality control.\n\n\n2.4.2 Reputation of authors and institutions\nWork from recognized experts and well-regarded institutions tends to be more reliable, though this should not be the sole criterion.\n\n\n2.4.3 Replication and consensus\nFindings that have been replicated by independent groups or that represent scientific consensus are more trustworthy than isolated claims.\n\n\n2.4.4 Transparency and reproducibility\nStudies that:\n\nClearly describe their methods\nShare their data and code\nDisclose potential conflicts of interest\nHave been successfully reproduced by others\n\nare more trustworthy than those lacking these features.\n\n\n2.4.5 Preprints and non-peer-reviewed sources\nPreprints can be valuable for accessing cutting-edge research, but they have not undergone peer review. When citing preprints:\n\nNote that they are preprints\nCheck whether a peer-reviewed version has since been published\nExercise extra scrutiny of the methods and conclusions\n\n\n\n2.4.6 Sources to generally avoid\nSome sources typically lack the rigor needed for scientific writing:\n\nWikipedia and general encyclopedias (though they can be useful starting points for finding primary sources)\nPopular press articles about scientific findings (cite the original research instead)\nBlogs and social media posts (unless discussing public discourse or documenting specific claims made in those venues)\nPredatory or pay-to-publish journals without genuine peer review\nRetracted papers",

    "text": "I recommend trying to replace Latin-derived words and phrases with Old English-derived equivalents (“Anglish” words) where possible; it generally makes writing simpler and easier to read. Latin words  create artificial barriers to understanding. Many Latin-derived words commonly used in scientific writing are composed from roots and affixes which are not commonly used in their basic forms; hence, readers cannot determine the meanings of these words by decomposing them. Instead, they need to memorize the meanings of these words directly. In contrast, the components of composite Anglish words are typically also used individually, so the meanings of the composites can be derived directly. Table 3.1 lists some common Latinate words and phrases and Anglish alternatives.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Commonly used Latin words and phrases and Anglish alternatives\n\n\n\n\n\nLatin\nAnglish\n\n\n\n\nprior to\nbefore\n\n\nnecessary\nneeded\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also https://bark-fa.github.io/Anglish-Translator/\nI am aware that this book, and even this chapter, contains many Latin word choices where there are Anglish alternatives. It is a work in progress, and also, I am not advocating 100% Anglish purity. Use whichever words and phrases you think your readers are most likely to understand easily. Preferring Anglish is merely a useful heuristic to help achieve our ultimate goal of producing clear, easy-to-read writing.\nJust to be clear, although I prefer Anglish words, I have no particular preference for Anglish people or culture; it is only a practical consideration, based on the realities of English as the current default language of science and the relatively-recent hybridization of the English language.",
