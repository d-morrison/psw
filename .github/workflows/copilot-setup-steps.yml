# GitHub Copilot Setup Steps for Principles of Scientific Writing
#
# This workflow configures the GitHub Copilot coding agent's environment
# by preinstalling R, Quarto and TinyTeX for rendering the book.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
#
# This workflow sets up:
# - R for running scripts
# - Quarto CLI for rendering
# - TinyTeX for PDF output

name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation,
# and allow manual testing through the repository's "Actions" tab
