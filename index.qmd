# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book will present my perspective on scientific writing,
in particular focusing on writing about statistical data analysis,
but also scientific writing generally
(and informative prose generally).
I intend to give it to academic mentees as a style guide reference,
and also use it as a notebook for myself.
